# DELTA
a Distal Enhancer Locating Tool based on AdaBoost and shape features of chromatin modifications

## Introduction
In the post-genomic era, accurate functional annotation of genomic sequences, especially DNA regulatory elements, has become an urgent need to understand of the complex mechanisms of human genome. Recent large-scale chromatin states mapping efforts revealed characteristic chromatin modification signatures for various types of functional DNA elements, promoting the emergence of a series of supervised and unsupervised-based methods for DNA elements prediction. However, these methods suffered from two major issues: (1) incomplete feature extraction of chromatin signatures and (2) inconsistency of histone modification importance between cell types. Here, we address these issues by introducing three important shape parameters of chromatin modifications from probability theory. We developed a novel method DELTA (a Distal Enhancer Locating Tool based on AdaBoost and shape features of chromatin modifications). We not only show that DELTA outperformed previous methods in different datasets, but also find that histone modification importance for enhancer prediction in different cell types are highly correlated. In summary, our results give insight into the consistency of variable importance of chromatin modifications across cell types and provide an accurate tool for enhancer prediction based on chromatin signatures.

## Parameters
-c / --chip_bed

ChIP-seq files contain chromatin modifications mapping data. User should provide ChIP-seq files separated by comma, e.g. H3K4me1.bed,H3K4me3.bed,H3K27ac.bed.

The BED format is defined in "http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1".

-R / --read

The "-R" option lets user read existing training and predicting data instead generate them from ChIP-seq files, which would be a time consuming process. WARNING: Use with care!!!, wrong training and predicting data could be load.

-s / --step

Step size of sliding window, should be integer times of bin size. A good step size should at least half length of the window size, because a small step size will produce redundant predictions as well as increase computing time.

--pvalue_threshold

P-value threshold for enhancer prediction. User could adjust number of prediction by tuning this parameter. 

## Output files

1. predicted_enhancer.bed is a BED format file containing the predicted enhancers. User should be aware that if the step size is smaller than window size, the predicted enhancers may be redundant. "uniq" command should be used in this situation to remove repetitive predictions.
2. adaboost.R is a R script generated by delta.py for executing AdaBoost algorithm.
3. tmp_dir is a directory contains temporary files created by delta.py. It should not be removed until the entire training and prediction is done.
